# Sum Type

> A sum type is a ***discriminated*** union of values, and can be thought of as an ***OR*** on types.

# ADT - Algebraic Data Types

> An ADT is a potentially ***recursive*** ***sum type*** of ***product types***.

# Witness Type

> A Witness type describes properties of a sum type's branches at the type level

# GADT - Generalized Algebraic Data Types

> A GADT is a ***sum*** type with one of more ***witness*** types, each equiped with a ***type eqauality***
